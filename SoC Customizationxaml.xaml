Fabrication time customization produces a device with reconfigurable fabric,  typically containing reconfigurable elements joined together by reconfigurable interconnections. For soft processors such as MicroBlaze from Xilinx or Nios from Altera the challenge is to support instruction processors efficiently using resources in a reconfigurable fabric such as an FPGA.  Efficiency can be improved by exploiting device specific features or run-time re-configurability.   A third alternative is to implement the instruction processor in ASIC technology (e.g Tensilica) and a suitable interface is developed to enable the processor to benefit from custom instructions implemented in a reconfigurable fabric.

For extremely low power designs, optimizations to clocking, memory and processor organization is required. The deposited thin film batteries, RF communications, digital sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) completes the ASOC plan. There are many system configurations providing various trade-offs across power, RF and speed budgets.  e.g include RFID chips, smart cards and chip implanted credit cards. With a power budget of 1uW, the micro architecture of the ASOC (AC) is different from the conventional processor. "/>
