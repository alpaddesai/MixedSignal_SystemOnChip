An NoC is more than a single shared bus, it provides point to point connections between two hosts attached to the network either by crossbar switches or through node based switches. It provides high aggregate bandwidth through parallel links, it uses a layered approach to communications, i t supports pipelining and data buffering. The IP blocks in the SoC communicate through the interconnect which is accessed through an interconnect interface unit (ICU), this unit enables a common interface protocol for all SoC Modules.  One must select a suitable interconnect architecture: BW, latency, master and peripherals, concurrency requirement (# of simultaneous communication channels operate in parallel, additional channel improve system BW), packet or bus transaction, ICU and multiple clock domains."/>

A process called arbitration determines ownership of the bus either by priority or the bus protocol.  A bus bridge is a module that connects two buses which may not necessarily be the same type.  Functionality includes * Standard conversion of format of protocol to another. * Segmentation  hence both separate buses can operate at the same time * Improve system performance by offering buffering facilities for transactions that have to occur from one bus to another.
